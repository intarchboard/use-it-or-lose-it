That's a bit stronger than just complementing each other, as you say above.

After all, the benefit is not necessarily something that the implementer sees, it's one that the community as a whole sees (or might see) in the fullness of time.\r\n\r\nAfter all, if you couch a question about deploying encryption in the same way, you might have similar trouble in justification.  The answer is usually tied into hedging strategies against the risk of future problems.  \r\n\r\nFor example, you might reasonably say that making cleartext DNS queries in most networks is benign.  And the cost of deploying encryption is considerable. More so if you start with the understanding that most network operators accord those requests with due respect, including taking every effort to ensure that they are the only ones that see those packets.  If you consider the breadth of possible networks and the span of time, the occasional instances of failures in that regard might lead to a different risk assessment.\r\n\r\nCollectively, the QUIC working group has expended significant energy on this general question.  This is in part because of a deeper understanding of the risk profile in that environment.  This stuff really does happen.  I don't know if I recounted the story about Google's QUIC breaking a few years ago due to bad assumptions made about the semantics of a key protocol element.  Add the scars from multiple bad experiences with TLS and you might appreciate that there is some desire to address the problem proactively.\r\n\r\nOf course, even with the desire to protect future extensibility, there is some justified skepticism about the efficacy of greasing as a general mechanism.
